// Boundary derivation: the pure byte-level
// function from a user-supplied system-module directory file to the guest
// image the directory mode maps for a boundary-pair module (ntdll, win32u).
// The real file is the base: the derived image is the source's own folded
// image (SizeOfImage and the section list are the source's), taken through
// the same load pipeline as every real module - build, real relocation
// table, then the resident IAT/delayed-import binding that happens after
// the whole set is known. The boundary dispositions (syscall numbers, the
// four-kind classification, the counting whitelist, compat answers) ride
// the address-level runtime table this function returns - the EAT keeps
// its source addresses and the verified syscall stubs keep their source
// bytes, so nothing in the image depends on a synthesized stub. Image
// writes are limited to the explicit whitelist: the reserved DOS e_res2
// marker slot (verified zero in the source), manifest-declared data slots
// whose mapped bytes are free (all zero), and manifest-defined
// compat/intercept stub bodies at their own export addresses. The
// synthetic-era fixed weld slots are retired on this route - the derive
// never lays out or overwrites image content outside the whitelist.
// Syscall service exports keep their `mov eax, <num>` shape only after the
// source body passes stub-shape validation - the name prefix never
// decides. Same input bytes and base in, byte-identical image out. The
// classification input is the versioned boundary manifest's rule set; an
// export it does not cover is a named rejection, never a guessed stub. No
// unicorn, no host state - fully unit-testable.
