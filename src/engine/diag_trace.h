// Engine diagnostic traces. The log facade is the only way a diagnostic may leave
// this library - the host installs the sink, sets the threshold, and can silence the
// whole stream - so the traces that used to fprintf(stderr, ...) are routed here, and
// this header is the spelling that makes "send it to the host's stream" impossible to
// reach by accident.
//
// Two conditions gate a record, and both are checked before anything is rendered:
//   * the site switch - the environment variable this trace has always had, cached in
//     a function-local static because these paths run once per guest instruction and a
//     getenv per record would add an allocation and a lock to a hook path. It is
//     therefore a once-per-process decision: a test that wants a switch set has to set
//     it before the first record, which is what tests/engine_trace_test.cpp's main()
//     does.
//   * the host's threshold - log::would_log(), so a disabled host costs no rendering.
//
// Which is the contract the default path keeps: with the switch off, a trace site is
// one bool; with the switch on but the host's threshold above the record, one bool
// plus one would_log(); and std::format - the only allocation - runs for a record
// somebody asked for.
